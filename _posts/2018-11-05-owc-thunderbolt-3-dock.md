## "Great Expansion for a MacBook Pro User!"

Let me start off by saying - this is my first OWC product - and I love it.  First impressions are great!

The Thunderbolt 3 Dock scene is pretty sparse, and when adding in power charging requirements for the larger 15" MacBook Pro it is desolate.  This is why I am particularly excited to review the new version of the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock (14 Port), which besides adding more ports from their older 12 port edition, boasts 85W charging (the original capped out at 60W like most accessories on the market).  I was an original pre-order of their first Thunderbolt 3 Dock, but when I learned that it only put out 60W I cancelled my order, so this is huge for me to be trying out.

When unboxing the dock you will be greeted with a very sleek, compact, and lightweight device in hopefully the color that matches your Mac, either the classic silver or space-grey.  The dock comes with a larger power supply than the original (from what I have read) and a 0.5m (1.6ft) Thunderbolt 3 cable.  From there it is VERY simple - plug in the dock to power and plug the Thunderbolt cable into your computer.  I am currently running two displays with it - one is using a USB-C style cable to DisplayPort, and one is on a Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable - and I have no problems running both.  I am also utilizing the built-in gigabit ethernet port for my wired connection.

There are a plethora of USB ports as well on this dock.  Of note there are 4 USB-A ports on the back (one labeled High Powered Port), and 1 USB-A and 1 USB-C port on the front.  The USB-A ports are all USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, while the USB-C on the front is USB 3.1 Gen 2.  I have my portable hard drive hooked up in the front's USB-A port and it works great.

Other ports to mention are the super convenient headphone jack (which from what I read support a mic as well), a SD card slot and a surprising MicroSD card slot.  There is also an optical audio out port on the back.

## Pros
* Lots of connectivity
* Ability to hook up dual displays
* 85W of power to the computer
* Great looks
* Easy setup
* OWC Support is stellar

## Cons
* Cost - this one isn't priced for everyone to have.
* There is a slight whine when plugging in a bus powered device in the back USB ports (OWC is currently working on this with me)^

<br/><br/>


All in all - this is a fantastic device, I have had 0 issues with it from a workflow perspective.  I am able to plug my laptop in to it and it just recognizes all of the gear that is plugged in and works.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a dock with a wide list of ports and who also needs 85W to keep their laptop charging while running at full load.  I have also looked a bunch of different offerings - and none of them seem to have the right port configuration - until now.

_^ Note on the "whine when plugging in a bus powered devise" in the cons section:  I have tried a few devices to confirm this and it only happens if the device isn't self-powered (like a hard-drive with it's own power supply), and you can easily work around this by using the front USB port until OWC releases a fix._

_I am also currently working with OWC on this issue, and will provide an update as soon as I have one._
