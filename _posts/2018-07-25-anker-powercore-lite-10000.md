I have wanted to try one of these for some time now.  Not much to really report though on it (it's a battery pack AND it's made by Anker).  The PowerCore Lite 10000 is light-weight and functional. It has micro-USB AND USB-C charging ports which is really nice for people who have a lot of USB-C accessories laying around.  The actual battery pack feels very solid in your hand - and has a nice textured finish.  It also comes with a "travel pouch" which for me will just keep it from getting scratched up in my bag.  I think this is a great product, great size, and great feature set - and would highly recommend.
