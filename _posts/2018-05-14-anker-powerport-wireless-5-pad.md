Anker is the first brand I look to for power cables and wireless chargers. Their products do exactly as they say they will and last. The PowerPort Wireless 5 Pad charges my phone. Doesn't seem to get hot like some accessories do. It also seems to be well made. The top surface won't scratch or harm your device and the bottom won't damage furniture. Another well made device.
