This product review came with a lot of hesitation because I am very picky when it
comes to headphones (and I have owned a lot of them).  When I fly I typically
wear a pair of Bose QuietComfort just because I've had them since they were the
"only" noise cancelling headphones on the market.  I frequently use a pair of
Shure SE215 (which are not wireless or bluetooth) and love them as well.  So to
say I was skeptical of a $40 pair of earbuds would be an understatement. They
are a wonderful pair for the price.  They are comfortable, and sweat resistant which
is a huge plus.  I haven't put them through all of the paces for what they are
but I will.

Things I need to verify still:
* How sweat proof they really are.
* Do they really last 12 hours
* Will they still be comfortable in my ears after a few hours (this is super
  important as most earbuds annoy me after an hour or so)

So check back and see what comes of this.
