Another quality product from Anker. I already had PowerPort Wireless 5 Pad so having a second one was just a bonus for me. The stand that comes with this bundle is a good looking, sleek stand that fits well on my desk. It also feels well made and isn't too tall (where it blocks my monitors on my desk). Once again Anker builds products that do exactly what they are supposed to, and look good. I do love having these chargers all over the house.
